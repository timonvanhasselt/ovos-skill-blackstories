An [OpenVoiceOS ](https://www.openvoiceos.org) prototype skill of Black Riddles. You are playing against/with AI, but you can play with the whole family or friends. 

Black riddles are mysterious/ strange puzzles. They tell a short story that sounds confusing or scary, and you have to figure out what really happened by thinking carefully and asking yes-or-no questions. The answer is often surprising!
